## Steps to create latex based resume

- I have used Jake Ryan overleaf template. So login to https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs website.
- Remove all the existing content of this template with the uploaded `main.tex` file here on my github.
- Please update your personal details properly. Re-compile the content that you replaced with `main.tex` file on overleaf website.
- Whoa! You got resume just like mine. Now update as per your choice.
